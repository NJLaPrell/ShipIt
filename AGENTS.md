# AGENTS.md

## Project: ShipIt

This repository implements an AI-native Software Development Life Cycle optimized for AI agent teams rather than human limitations.

> **Note:** For quick start and usage instructions, see [README.md](./README.md)

## Definition of Done

A feature/bugfix is "done" when ALL of these pass:

- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Lint + typecheck pass (`pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`)
- [ ] New/changed behavior has corresponding tests
- [ ] Public APIs are documented
- [ ] Intent acceptance criteria all checked
- [ ] No unresolved security findings
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Conventions

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier enforced via pre-commit hooks
- Prefer configuration over custom code

### Development Process

- **Tests before implementation** (Spec → Tests → Code)
- All assumptions must be explicit
- Check `_system/do-not-repeat/` before proposing designs
- Small, reviewable diffs preferred

### Forbidden Patterns

- No `any` type (use `unknown` if needed)
- No `eval()`
- No `innerHTML` (use safe DOM methods)
- No circular dependencies

## Agent System

This repo uses an AI-native SDLC. Key directories (agent-visible):

| Directory                             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `work/intent/`                        | Planned work (features, bugs, tech-debt); templates/ for kind-specific (API, frontend, infra, bugfix, refactor). New templates must include required fields from \_TEMPLATE.md (Type, Status, Motivation, Acceptance, etc.).             |
| `work/workflow-state/`                | Current execution state (flat for single intent; per-intent dirs when multiple intents active — see [workflow-state-layout.md](./_system/architecture/workflow-state-layout.md) and [parallel-workflow.md](./docs/parallel-workflow.md)) |

| `.override/`                          | User customizations (rules, commands, scripts, config) that persist across framework upgrades. NEVER touched by `shipit upgrade`.                                                                                                        |
| `tests/test-project/`                 | Internal test project for framework validation (gitignored). Created by `scripts/init-project.sh` for `/test_shipit` command.                                                                                                            |

`_system/artifacts/SYSTEM_STATE.md` is generated by `scripts/generate-system-state.sh` and read by the Steward. `_system/artifacts/usage.json` holds token/cost entries per phase/intent (aggregate only; no prompt or response content). Record with `pnpm usage-record`; view with `pnpm usage-report` or `/status`. `_system/artifacts/confidence-calibration.json` stores stated confidence vs actual outcome per verification; view with `pnpm calibration-report` or `/calibration-report`.

**Calibration:** How well stated confidence matches reality. The report shows (a) calibration error (MAE) and Brier score, (b) success rate by confidence bin (well-calibrated: e.g. 0.8–0.9 bin has ~85% success), (c) over/under-confidence summary. **Improve calibration:** Lower stated confidence when uncertain; tune analysis/Steward prompts to output more accurate confidence; use `calibration-report --fail-on-threshold 0.2` in CI to catch drift. Optional alert: script warns when recent high-confidence decisions have &lt;50% success.

**Full directory map:** See [\_system/architecture/CANON.md](./_system/architecture/CANON.md) Directory Boundaries and [docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md](./docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md).

## Human Interrupts Required For

Humans intervene **ONLY** at these gates:

| Gate                  | When                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Plan Approval**     | Before implementation starts                |
| **High-Risk Changes** | Auth, payments, permissions, infra, PII     |
| **Kill/Rollback**     | Kill criteria triggered or major regression |

**Rollback safety:** Use `/rollback <intent-id>` for guided rollback. High-risk steps (force, drop, delete, migration down, production, auth, secret) are **display only** — run manually. No automatic force-push or data deletion. Run rollback for one intent at a time.
| **Product Judgment** | Subjective UX/taste/value tradeoffs |

**Response time expectation:** Minutes (real-time collaboration)

## Slash Commands

| Command        | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/ship`        | Run full SDLC workflow (Phases 1-6) |
| `/new_intent`  | Create a new intent file            |
| `/verify`      | Run verification phase only         |
| `/kill`        | Kill an intent with rationale       |
| `/drift_check` | Calculate drift metrics             |

### Commands and scripts

- **Slash command files** live in `.cursor/commands/` and use **underscores** in filenames (e.g. `init_project.md`, `drift_check.md`).
- **Command manifest:** The full list of slash commands, pnpm scripts, and categories lives in `scripts/command-manifest.yml`. Run `/help` (or `pnpm help`) to see the list; help output is built from the manifest.
- **Executable scripts** live in `scripts/` and use **hyphens** (e.g. `init-project.sh`, `fix-intents.sh`). New scripts should source `scripts/lib/common.sh` (error handling, colors) or `scripts/lib/intent.sh` (intent resolution); see `scripts/README.md`.
- **Multiple active intents:** When more than one intent is active, pass intent-id explicitly (e.g. `/ship F-001`, `/verify F-002`). "Current" for a session is the intent-id passed to the last command or the single intent in `work/workflow-state/active.md`. See [docs/parallel-workflow.md](./docs/parallel-workflow.md).
- Prefer **`pnpm run <script>`** when a script exists: pnpm script names use hyphens. Examples: `/fix` → `pnpm fix`, `/help` → `pnpm help`, `/verify` → `pnpm verify`, `/drift_check` → `pnpm drift-check`, `/new_intent` → `pnpm new-intent`. See `package.json` scripts for the full list.

## Truth Hierarchy

When facts conflict, agents MUST know which source wins. This prevents 30–40% of "AI confusion" bugs.

**Truth Stack (highest to lowest precedence):**

1. **Runtime behavior** — What the system actually does
2. **Tests** — Executable assertions
3. **Invariants** — Hard constraints that must never be violated
4. **Specs** — Formal requirements
5. **Architecture canon** — CANON.md boundaries
6. **Comments** — Human annotations in code
7. **Human opinion** — Always last

> **Rule:** If tests contradict comments, tests win. If runtime contradicts tests, that's a bug to fix—runtime is truth, tests are intent.

## Risk Levels

| Level      | Domains                                    | Review         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **High**   | Auth, payments, permissions, infra, PII    | Human required |
| **Medium** | New dependencies, API changes, performance | AI review      |
| **Low**    | Docs, refactors, tests, internal tooling   | Automerge      |
