# Assumptions Log

This file tracks implicit assumptions that have been identified during development. Assumptions are where most outages hide—making them explicit and testable prevents surprises.

## Format

Each entry should include:

- **Assumption:** Clear statement of what is assumed
- **Context:** Where/when this assumption applies
- **Risk:** What breaks if assumption is wrong
- **Validation:** How to test/verify the assumption
- **Date:** When assumption was identified
- **Intent ID:** Related intent (if any)
- **Category:** Domain | Technical | Security
